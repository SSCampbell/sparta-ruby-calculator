# Sparta Global Academy Homework -- Ruby Calculator

## Project Review:

### In this project I had to create a Calculator using the new Ruby/gem programming skills currently reviewed.

## Project Download:  
### Download from the files created and transferred to GITHUB
### The repository was created on GITHUB and cloned to access from terminal  
### Used a RUBY file

## Using RUBY tools such as:
```RUBY
$stdout.puts 'What is the second number?'
$stdout.flush
num_2 = $stdin.gets.chomp.to_i

sum = add_sum(num_1, num_2)
puts "#{num_1} + #{num_2}  =  #{sum}"
```
